# Substat Tiers

Displays substat tiers and effects.

FFXIV doesn't really explain in detail what each substat (Critical Hit, Determination, Direct Hit, Skill/Spell Speed, Tenacity, Piety) does, or what your stats actually mean. This plugin attempts to do exactly that, showing what benefit you get from these substats. 

These substats work on a tier system, so an increase of 1 or 2 stat doesn't actually do anything most of the time. This plugin will also show you how close you are to hitting the next tier and also how much above the minimum for your current tier you are.

This plugin uses collected data from Allagan Studies, a project by AhkMorning (https://www.akhmorning.com/allagan-studies/) to explain how the numbers work. All of the raw data was imported from this reference, then calculated in this plugin to give the results shown.
